# Assassin
My CS211 Fundementals of Computer Science class at Bellevue College gave me multiple options for my final project and I chose to create a game called Assassin located in the book "Building Java Programs A back To Basics Approach 5th Edition" in Chapter 16 programming project #4. 

Summary: Assassin a game where participants try to contact each other in order to kill them and remain the last one standing. This project will simulate this as an online activity with multiple additional features.
